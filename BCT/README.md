I have calculated BCT and DDT tables for 2 ciphers: AES (8 bit Sbox) and Twine(4 bit Sbox). 
My frequncey tables for both the Sboxes have mathced the observation of the paper (Refer page 10 of the paper attached in pdf).
Further Sbox can be plugged in as separate .py files and experiments can be run with minor modifications.
